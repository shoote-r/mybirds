# Presentation
This web app use is for each member to list the birds in their garden or their surroundings. Each member has a garden (inventory), birds (object) and can create aviaries (galerie).

Birds are lowkey cool so I thought they deserved more recognition yk


# How to use 
- Go on the homepage ("/").

- From there you can check the navigation bar and click on "Your Gardens", this will display all the current Gardens in the web app. You can either edit or show a garden.

- When showing a garden you see all its properties and you can display all the birds in that garden by clicking on "All birds".

- When on a bird, you can either edit or delete it.
